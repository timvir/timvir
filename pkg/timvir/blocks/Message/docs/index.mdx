# Message

The `<Message>` component is a simple container for messages.

<Sample variant="basic" />

## Variants

The Message block comes in four variants: **plain**, **info**, **warning**, and **alert**.
Each variant uses a different color and icon.
Below are examples in which situations to use the variants.

<Sample variant="basic">
This is the **plain** variant. Use it for simple notes, neutral remarks, or secondary information that doesnâ€™t require emphasis.

_Example:_ This component is defined in src/components/Message.tsx.

</Sample>

<Sample variant="basic" props={{ variant: "info" }}>
This is the **info** variant. Use it to share helpful or contextual information about the code or component.

_Example:_ This hook is useful for managing form state.

</Sample>

<Sample variant="basic" props={{ variant: "warning" }}>
  This is the **warning** variant. Use it to call attention to potential pitfalls, limitations, or special cases to consider when using the code.

_Example:_ This component has not been tested with server-side rendering.

</Sample>

<Sample variant="basic" props={{ variant: "alert" }}>
This is the **alert** variant. Use it for strict requirements, do-nots, or critical caveats that must be followed when using the code.

_Example:_ You must not use this component inside a React Suspense boundary.

</Sample>

## Content

You can use arbitrary markdown inside the message, or even blocks.
Note that not all combinations have been exhaustively tested.
If you come across markup that doesn't render well, please raise an issue in the Timvir project.

<Sample variant="basic">
  **Short Messages** should place the title in front of the message and make it stand out.
</Sample>

<Sample variant="basic">
### Longer Messages

Longer messages should make the title a separate block element. This body uses [links](#) and _italic_ text.

And multiple paragraphs. And even a component:

<Swatch value="#FF00FF" />
</Sample>
