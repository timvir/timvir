# ColorBar

A `ColorBar` is a horizontal arrangement of swatches.

<Sample variant="basic" />

Pass the colors as an array of CSS color values.

<Code language="jsx" highlightedLines={[4]}>
  <Sample variant="basic" as="source" />
</Code>

The ColorBar works comfortably with as few as two colors and as many as 20.
If you specify more colors than that, each individual swatch becomes tiny, especially on smaller viewports.

<ColorBar
  values={[
    { value: "#FFE4A0", name: "Yellow Submarine", ancestry: "Yellow 001" },
    { value: "#A67908", name: "Yellow Spaceship", ancestry: "Yellow 999", contrastValue: "white" },
  ]}
/>
