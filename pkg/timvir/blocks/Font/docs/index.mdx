# Font

The Font block displays a sample text in a given font, and provides basic information about the font metrics.
The metrics show the actual, computed font size and line height values from the DOM.
They are updated in real time to support fonts that make use of dynamic CSS units (such as `vw`).
To provide context (such as where this font is used, or instructions for developers how to apply the font style), use the info option.

## Timvir Font System

The samples below illustrate the font system used by Timvir itself.
Note that the Timvir font system is currently (for most parts) not responsive.
The font sizes remain the same across all viewport sizes.

In Timvir itself, ont sizes are always specified in rem, line height in unitless values.
This ensures the font size scales when the user has set a non-standard font size in their browser (currently Chrome and Firefox offer such option, Safari does not).

<Sample variant="timvir/h1" />
<Sample variant="timvir/h2" />
<Sample variant="timvir/h3" />
<Sample variant="timvir/h4" />
<Sample variant="timvir/body1" />
<Sample variant="timvir/caption" />
