      The first of the folioâ€™s two sans serifs was simply called Grotesque. This was a duplicate of the Moderne
      Steinschriften types created at the Benjamin Krebs Nachfolger typefoundry of Frankfurt am Main, published in 1865.
      The second was an italic named Cursiv-Grotesque, which probably came to Theinhardt from the J.H. Rust & Co.
      foundry of Offenbach am Main and Vienna. Rust had imported the larger sizes of this typeface from Americirca They
      then created the three smallest sizes themselves, publishing them in 1875.
