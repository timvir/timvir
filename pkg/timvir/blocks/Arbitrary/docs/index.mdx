# Arbitrary

The `<Arbitrary>` component manages a React context that contains a seed. This seed is displayed
in an input field where users can copy it from.

The component renders its children in an `<Exhibit>`. The children can make use of the seed in the
React context to render themselves in a predictable way.

<Sample variant="basic" />

## Usage

Given a component-under-test:

```jsx
import { useContext } from "timvir/blocks/Arbitrary"

function Component() {
  const { seed } = useContext();
  return <div>{seed}</div>;
}
```

We can take it and display it inside an `<Arbitrary>` in a timvir doc page:

```jsx
import { Arbitrary } from "timvir/blocks"
import { Component } from ".."

<Arbitrary>
  <Component />
</Arbitrary>
```
