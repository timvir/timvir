# Exhibit

The `<Exhibit>` is a block which is used to present something–usually a React component–in a nice way. It's a way to say:

<Sample variant="basic" />

<Code language="jsx">
  <Sample variant="basic" as="source/markup" />
</Code>

Think of it as a `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` for React components.

Add a title to the exhibit if it helps the reader to understand the exhibit better. The title is placed snuggly to the exhibit.

<Exhibit title="This Is Not A Button" caption="It's an input element, of type text">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Type something…" style={{ boxSizing: "border-box", width: "100%", padding: 8 }} />
</Exhibit>

## Bleed

Use the `bleed` prop to control how much the checkered background extends beyond the box of the element itself.

<Exhibit bleed={0} caption="Bleed 0">
  <div
    style={{ height: 40, padding: "0 16px", background: "teal", color: "white", display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}
  />
</Exhibit>

<Exhibit bleed={4} caption="Bleed 4">
  <div
    style={{ height: 40, padding: "0 16px", background: "teal", color: "white", display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}
  />
</Exhibit>

<Exhibit bleed={12} caption="Bleed 12">
  <div
    style={{ height: 40, padding: "0 16px", background: "teal", color: "white", display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}
  />
</Exhibit>

<Exhibit bleed={24} caption="Bleed 24">
  <div
    style={{ height: 40, padding: "0 16px", background: "teal", color: "white", display: "flex", alignItems: "center" }}
  />
</Exhibit>
