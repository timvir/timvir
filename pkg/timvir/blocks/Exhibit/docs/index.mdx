# Exhibit

The `<Exhibit>` is a block which presents something–usually a React component–in a nice way.

The presented element is placed on top of a checkered background.
This helps illustrating which parts of the element are transparent, or if the element comes with a specific background color.

A bit of padding is included all around the presented element.
Together with the checkered background, it makes the `<Exhibit>` block stand out next plain text or other blocks.
You can tweak the bleed size, or disable the bleed altogether if you want to draw attention to the exact box size of the presented element itself.

The caption, if provided, is placed below the block.
Use it to explain what is being presented, or provide contex around it.
Think of the `<Exhibit>` block as a `<figure>` + `<figcaption>` for React components.

<Sample variant="basic" />

## Usage

Import `Exhibit` from the `timvir/blocks` module, then use in a Timvir mdx page like so:

```jsx
<Exhibit caption="Here goes your caption">
  <YourReactComponent />
</Exhibit>
```

## Bleed

Use the `bleed` prop to control how much the checkered background extends beyond the box of the element itself.
If you set the bleed explicitly, it is not recommended to use more than 16px.
That is the page margin on small viewports and a bleed larger than that can mess with the page layout.

Setting bleed to zero (0) does not remove the checkered background.
It will still be visible behind your element (if your element is transparent).
To entirely remove any bleed and checkered background, render your element directly, without wrapping it in an `<Exhibit>`.

<Sample variant="bleed" props={{ bleed: 0 }} />
<Sample variant="bleed" props={{ bleed: 8 }} />
<Sample variant="bleed" props={{ bleed: 16 }} />
<Sample variant="bleed" />

## Theme

Timvir itself respects the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature.
Its UI automatically adjusts based on that user preference.
However, sometimes the elements shown in an `<Exhibit>` need to be shown on a light or dark background.
In those cases, you can force a light or dark theme with the `theme` prop.

<Grid>
  <div>
    <Sample variant="theme" props={{ theme: "light" }} />
  </div>
  <div>
    <Sample variant="theme" props={{ theme: "dark" }} />
  </div>
</Grid>
