# Code

The `<Code>` component provides syntax highlighting for code blocks.

<Code language="tsx">
  <Sample variant="basic" as="source" />
</Code>

The default language is "markdown", but you can specify any of the languages
which are supported by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

<Code language="javascript">const answer = 42;</Code>

## Full-width

Full-width code blocks provide more space for the code. They are not constrained to the center column.

<Code language="javascript" fullWidth>
  {`(defun csg-intersection-intersect-all (obj-a obj-b)
   (lambda (ray)
     (flet ((inside-p (obj) (lambda (d) (inside-p obj (ray-point ray d)))))
       (merge 'fvector (remove-if-not (inside-p obj-b) (intersect-all obj-a ray)) (remove-if-not (inside-p obj-a) (intersect-all obj-b ray)) #'<))))`}
</Code>
