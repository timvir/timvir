# Viewport

The `<Viewport>` component is a full-width component which is a lightly
interactive wrapper around an `<iframe>`. The viewport can be resized to
simulate different device widths. The height of the iframe will automatically
adjust to the iframe content.

The component does not provide the full functionality of the browsers responsive
device mode simulation. In particular, it can't simulate network / CPU
throttling, nor can it change the user agent. It's purpose is to provide a
simple interface to test your components at different viewport widths.

Since `<Viewport>` uses an `<iframe>`, you must provide an URL which can be
loaded into it. If you used the timvir cli to scaffold your component, you
already have one such sample (in `src/components/â€¦/samples/basic.tsx`). Make
that sample available via a Next.js page and load it into the `<Viewport>`.

See also [Concepts: Component Sample](/concepts/component-sample).

You can use any URL, it does not have to be <Sample variant="trigger"
target="local">local</Sample>, it can also be any <Sample variant="trigger"
target="public">public url</Sample>. Note that if the URL is pointing to another
origin, it must allow embedding (not block it via `X-Frame-Options` or
`Content-Security-Policy`).

<Viewport id="sample" src="/docs/components/Grid/samples/basic" />

## Loading Behaviour

The `<Viewport>` displays a gray, animated background while the iframe is
loading.

<Viewport src="/api/slow" />

## Unsupported content

When the Viewport points to something else than a HTML document (eg. an image),
it'll stay the default height, but display the contents nonetheless.

TODO: display a nice error message describing the problem.

<Viewport src="/assets/image.jpg" />
