Use the New JSX Transform

The New JSX Transform was released as part of React 17.
This transform reduces bundle sizes and improves performance.
For more details, see the announcement on the React blog: [Introducing the New JSX Transform](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html).
As Timvir already requires React 17 or later, this should not have any impact to users.
