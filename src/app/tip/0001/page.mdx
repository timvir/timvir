# TIP 0001

### Regular exhibit

An exhibit across the main column, usually used for mid-sized components.

<Exhibit caption="Caption">
  <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 100 }} />
</Exhibit>

### Multiple exhibits in a grid

To showcase a small component in different variations, we often use Exhibit inside a Grid.
Our Grid component places up to three items into a row (in the main column). Often the same
component is used in all grid items.

<Grid>
  <Exhibit caption="Variant 1">
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 52 }} />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Variant 2">
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 56 }} />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Variant 3">
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 48 }} />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Variant 4">
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 36 }} />
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit caption="Variant 5">
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 56 }} />
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>

### Exhibit with a small aspect ratio

Sometimes the content of the exhibit is taller than wide. This leaves space next to the exhibit
on the same row.

<Grid>
  <Exhibit>
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 400 }} />
  </Exhibit>
  <div style={{ gridColumn: "2 / span 2" }}>
    <Code>Here Be Space</Code>
  </div>
</Grid>

This form could also make use of the extended width column to provide more space for both the exhibit and code.

<Grid className={extendedWidth}>
  <Exhibit>
    <div style={{ background: "magenta", height: 400 }} />
  </Exhibit>
  <div style={{ gridColumn: "2 / span 2" }}>
    <Code>Here Be Space</Code>
  </div>
</Grid>

<div style={{ marginTop: 100 }} />
