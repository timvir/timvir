# A Brief History of the Internet

The internet has revolutionized communication and the way we access information. Its origins can be traced back to the 1960s, but it wasn't until the development of the World Wide Web in the 1990s that it became a global phenomenon.

## The Early Days

The internet's predecessor was ARPANET, a project funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. You can read more about it at [https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/history-internet/brief-history-internet/). The goal was to create a decentralized network that could withstand a nuclear attack.

## The Rise of the Web

The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. His vision was to create a system of interconnected hypertext documents. One of the first web browsers was [Mosaic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)>), which played a significant role in popularizing the web. The web's growth was exponential, and by the mid-1990s, companies like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) and [eBay](https://www.ebay.com) were founded, marking the beginning of e-commerce.

## Key Milestones

- **1969:** [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) is created.
- **1983:** The [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc882) is introduced.
- **1991:** The World Wide Web becomes publicly available. Check out the [first website here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).
- **1993:** The [Mosaic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)>) web browser is released.
- **1998:** [Google](https://www.google.com) is founded.

## Technical Foundations

The web is built on a foundation of open standards. Key among these are `HTML` (HyperText Markup Language) for structuring content, and `HTTP` (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for transmitting it. You can learn more about the latter in the original specification, [`RFC 2616`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616). These standards are what make the web a universal and interoperable platform.

## A Vision for the Future

> "The dream behind the Web is of a common information space in which we communicate by sharing information. Its universality is essential: the fact that a hypertext link can point to anything, be it personal, local or global, be it draft or highly polished."
>
> â€” [Tim Berners-Lee, A.M.I.C.E., D.C.S.](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/)

The internet continues to evolve, with new technologies and applications emerging all the time.
