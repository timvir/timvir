The `@timvir/macro` package exports [babel macros](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros). To use this in your project,
you first have to [set up babel](https://github.com/kentcdodds/babel-plugin-macros/blob/master/other/docs/user.md). After that
you can use the macros.

The package exports the following macros:

- `<Sample />`: Replaces itself either with the sample JSX Element, or a JSX Expression Container which contains the source code of the sample.
