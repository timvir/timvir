# Next.js

Timvir assumes a very specific setup of your Next.js project. In particular:

- Source must be placed into the `src/` folder, and consequently, pages are placed in `src/pages/`.
- Your components are placed into `src/components/`.
- Timvir assumes management of the `src/pages/docs/components/` folder.
- Timvir specific integration code is placed into `src/timvir/` (eg. `src/timvir/toc.ts`).

If you Next.js project has a compatible setup, follow these steps:

1.  Add [mdxjs](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next) support into your project.
2.  Create a page wrapper. Copy the following code into `src/timvir/wrapper.tsx`:

```
import Link from "next/link";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import * as React from "react";
import { Page } from "timvir/core";

export default ({ children }: { children?: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <Page location={useRouter()} Link={Link} toc={[]}>
    {children}
  </Page>
);
```

3.  Create (or update) your `_app.tsx` file to load the Timvir CSS:

```
import App from "next/app";
import "timvir/core/styles.css";
export default App;
```

4.  Create your first Timvir page. Place the following code into `src/pages/docs/index.mdx`:

```
import Wrapper from "@/timvir/app-page-wrapper";
export default Wrapper

# My First Timvir Page
```

5.  Open http://localhost:3000/docs/ to view the page you just created.
