## Add Timvir to an existing project

If you have an existing project and want to add Timvir to it, follow one these guides which are specific to the framework which you use:

- [Next.js](#nextjs)

### Next.js

Timvir assumes a very specific setup of your Next.js project. In particular:

- Source must be placed into the `src/` folder, and consequently, pages are placed in `src/pages/`.
- Your components are placed into `src/components/`.
- Timvir assumes management of the `src/pages/docs/components/` folder.
- Timvir specific integration code is placed into `src/timvir/` (eg. `src/timvir/toc.ts`).

If you Next.js project has a compatible setup, follow these steps:

1.  Add [mdxjs](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/next) support into your project.
2.  Create a page wrapper. Copy the following code into `src/timvir/wrapper.tsx`:

```
import Link from "next/link";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
import * as React from "react";
import { Page } from "timvir/core";

export default ({ children }: { children?: React.ReactNode }) => (
  <Page location={useRouter()} Link={Link} toc={[]}>
    {children}
  </Page>
);
```

3.  Create (or update) your `_app.tsx` file to load the Timvir CSS:

```
import App from "next/app";
import "timvir/core/styles.css";
export default App;
```

4.  Create your first Timvir page. Place the following code into `src/pages/docs/index.mdx`:

```
import Wrapper from "../../timvir/app-page-wrapper";
export default Wrapper

# My First Timvir Page
```

5.  Open http://localhost:3000/docs/ to view the page you just created.
