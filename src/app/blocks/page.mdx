# Blocks

Blocks are block-level components that you can use to build your pages.

## Usage

To use the components, you must import them from the `timvir/blocks` module.
Then use the component as any other MDX component.

```tsx
import { WebLink } from "timvir/blocks";

<WebLink url="https://example.com" />;
```
