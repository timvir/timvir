# Message Bus

Components on each Timvir page have access to a page-wide message bus. This bus provides
a standardized communication channel so that components can communicate with each
other. The main purpose is to allow implementing micro-interactions that combine multiple
components on a page.

The bus uses [wonka](https://wonka.kitten.sh/) (a streams/observable library) internally. Components
can subscribe to all messages that are sent to the bus, optionally filter them to receive
only those they are interested in.

## API

### useContext

The wonka [Subject](https://wonka.kitten.sh/api/sources#makesubject) is stored in a React Context.
To access it use the `useContext()` function from `@timvir/core`.

```typescript
import { useContext } from "@timvir/core";

function Component() {
  const { bus } = useContext();
}
```

Once you have access to the bus, you can subscribe to the messages. The following example
stores the last message in local React state.

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { useContext } from "@timvir/core";
import { pipe, subscribe } from "wonka";

function Component() {
  const { bus } = useContext();

  const [message, setMessage] = React.useState();
  React.useEffect(() => pipe(bus.source, subscribe(setMessage)).unsubscribe, [bus]);
}
```

### useProps / send

One common use case is to (temporarily) override the props of another component on the page.
For this purpose we have the `useProps()` hook and `send()` function.

If a component has an `id` (the standard HTML id attribute, a string), then it can be
targetted via the `send()` function. The following example instructs the component
with id `some-component-id` to use `rebeccapurple` instead of the original
value of the `color` prop.

```typescript
const context = useContext();
send(context.bus, "some-component-id", "merge", { color: "rebeccapurple" });
```

The targetted component can use the `useProps()` hook to merge any overrides into the
original props.

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { useProps } from "@timvir/core";

interface Props {
  color?: string;
}

function Component(props: Props) {
  const [{ color, ...rest }, { hasOverrides, reset }] = useProps(props);
  // color can be either the original value, or "rebeccapurple" when overridden.
}
```

## Message Format

The format of the messages is inspired by [D-Bus](https://dbus.freedesktop.org). At the moment
only the "SIGNAL" message type is supported (fire-and-forget messages with no ability
to reply to them). These map well to what other framework understand as _events_.

Each message includes header fields which allow receivers to filter the messages and
only process those that they know. The **path** identifies the object the message is
sent to. In Timvir it's usually some identifier of the component. The **interface**
and **member** identify the code that should handle the message.

In addition to the header fields, the message carries the message body, which
is of arbitrary type.

Example:

- **path**: `/dev/timvir/component/some-component-id`
- **interface**: `dev.timvir.Props`
- **member**: `merge`
- **body**: `{ color: "rebeccapurple" }`
