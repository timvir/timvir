# Search

Timvir provides hooks for integrating site-wide search functionality. It comes with
a builtin search based on the Table Of Contents. To use more advanced search providers,
such as [Algolia], you'll have to write the integration yourself.

To open the search, either:

 - Click on the «Quick Find» button in the sidebar, or
 - Press «CMD + P» anywhere on the page.

## Builtin Search Provider

The builtin search provider uses the _Table Of Contents_ as the search index. Because
of that it is rather limited: you'll only be able search the page URLs and titles,
but not within the page content.

First install the dependency:

```shell
npm i @timvir/search
```

Then pass the `search` prop to the `<Page>` component:

```typescript
import { defaultSearch, Search } from "@timvir/search";
import toc from "./toc";

export default function Wrapper({ children }) {
  return (
    <Page
      …
      search={{
        Component: (props) => (
          <Search {...props} {...defaultSearch(toc)} />
        ),
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
