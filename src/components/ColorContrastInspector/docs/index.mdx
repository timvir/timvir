# ColorContrastInspector

The `<ColorContrastInspector>` displays a matrix of foreground and background colors. For each combination,
the minimum opacity that the foreground color needs to have in order to satisfy a contrast ratio
(eg. WCAG recommendations for normal and large texts).

The background colors are shown as columns, the foreground colors as rows. The assumption is that you will have
fewer background colors than foreground colors, as it's easier to expand the matrix downwards. Only up to about
six background colors are supported.

<Sample variant="basic" />

## Reading the matrix

Each cell in this matrix shows either:

 - checkmark: if the contrast is ok
 - exclamation mark: contrast is sufficient only for large text sizes
 - cross: contrast too low (if the combination is whitelisted)

<Grid>
  <Exhibit bleed={8} caption="Small and large text ok">
    <div style={{ background: "#FFFFFF" }}>
      <Cell background="#FFFFFF" foreground="#000000" />
    </div>
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit bleed={8} caption="Only ok for large text">
    <div style={{ background: "#FFFFFF" }}>
      <Cell background="#FFFFFF" foreground="#888888" />
    </div>
  </Exhibit>
  <Exhibit bleed={8} caption="Contrast too low">
    <div style={{ background: "#FFFFFF" }}>
      <Cell background="#FFFFFF" foreground="#AAAAAA" isWhitelisted />
    </div>
  </Exhibit>
</Grid>

On hover the cell shows the minimum contrast that is required. A value of 100% means the foreground
color must be fully opaque.

If you whitelist a combination which doesn't have enough contrast, it's common courtesy to explain why.
Use for example the `<Message>` component for that:

<Message variant="warning">

The combination of **#00B1B2** and **#FFFFFF** does not have the required contrast, but we use it anyway because reasons and reasons.

</Message>

## Large number of background colors

If you have more than about six background colors, make the component extended-width, or even full-width.
The component is not responsive.
