# ColorBook

The `<ColorBook>` component provides an overview of different color palettes. The palettes are arranged horizontally, which means up to about 8 colors can be comfortable displayed in this book.

The user can interact with the book: select individual chapters. How selection is interpreted not handled by this component. In the example below
upon selecting one of the first two chapters, some extra elements are displayed below the `<ColorBook>`.

<div style={{ marginTop: "5vh" }}>
  <Sample variant="basic" />
</div>
