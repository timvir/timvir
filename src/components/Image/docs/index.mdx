# Image

DEPRECATED. @zhif/macro introduces a dependency to Babel which is unfortunate.
Need to find a better solution.

The `<Image>` displays an image ðŸ¤”. Use it together with the "@zhif/macro" package.

```
import { Image } from "@timvir/components"
import { importImage } from "@zhif/macro"

<Image {...importImage("../path/to/image.png")} />
```

## Example

<Exhibit>
  <Sample variant="basic" />
</Exhibit>
