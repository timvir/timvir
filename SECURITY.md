# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

While the project remains in the 0.x version range, only the latest version will be supported.
Once we release the second major version (ie. 2.x), we may reconsider this policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, let us know right away.
Use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/timvir/timvir/security/advisories/new) tab.
